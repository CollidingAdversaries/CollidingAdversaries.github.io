                <h2>About the Challenge</h2>
                <p id="abstract">
                    Adversarial machine learning has become a key area of research for improving model robustness and understanding model behavior. While much of the focus has been on domains like image recognition and natural language processing, adversarial attacks on tabular data — common in fields such as medicine and High Energy Physics (HEP) — have received less attention. 
                    This challenge seeks to address that gap by applying adversarial techniques to tabular data, a domain where adversarial vulnerabilities have been less explored despite their potential to improve model robustness. By focusing on tasks related to generating adversarial examples and creating models resilient to them, participants will explore innovative methods that could enhance robustness in fields such as particle physics. 
                    This challenge not only advances the development of more reliable machine learning systems but also offers opportunities to improve model explainability, performance under data scarcity, and inspire new approaches to adversarial robustness in various scientific fields.

            <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
            <div class = "subsection">
                <h3>Dataset</h3>
                <p>The dataset for both tasks stems from two separate CMS simulated datasets from the <a href="https://opendata.cern.ch/">CERN Open Data Portal</a>. Namely <a href="https://opendata.cern.ch/record/9581">TTJets</a> and <a href="https://opendata.cern.ch/record/9971">WWJets</a>. These two separate datasets are also the target classes.
                The entire dataset is made up of a total of 87 input features, which represent the Transverse Momentum, the Pseudo-Rapidity &eta;, and the Polar Coordinate &phi; of the 30 particles of a Jet with the highest Transverse Momentum.
                References to a more thorough description of the dataset, the pre-processing applied, and its physical interpretations are provided within the Codabench competitions (<a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7948/">Task 1</a> and <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7970/">Task 2</a>).</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "subsection">
                <h3>Model</h3>
                <p>The reference model used here is based on the TopoDNN model from this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09914">paper</a>. A summary of its parameters can be found in the accompanying Codabench competitions (<a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7948/">Task 1</a> and <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7970/">Task 2</a>).</p>

                <h3>Tasks</h3>
                <p>This challenge is made up of two separate tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Task 1</b>: Participants are asked to generate adversarial examples given a public set of inputs, in order to attack a pre-trained model. The goal here is to achieve high Fooling Ratios, while minimizing the perturbation to the individual inputs.</li>
                    <li><b>Task 2</b>: Participants are asked to build that is both robust to adversarial attacks, and also performs well on clean test samples.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>More details about the underlying tasks are provided in the accompanying Codabench competitions (<a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7948/">Task 1</a> and <a href="https://www.codabench.org/competitions/7970/">Task 2</a>).</p>
